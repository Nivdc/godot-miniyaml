I promise everything on this list will eventually be implemented (as long as I’m still alive 😅)—but I can’t say when.
If you need it tomorrow, you'll have to do it yourself.

TODO:  

- [x] Fix compatibility between the two error-handling systems(`assert` and `YAMLResult`)  
- [x] Allow loading data with missing fields  
- [x] Try to fix infinite loop issues.

<br>

- [x] Provide a distribution package that doesn’t pollute the namespace  
- [x] Create utility classes to reduce code duplication  
- [ ] Added better behavior control settings  
- [ ] (Just for fun) Let's try dump miniyaml  
<br>

- [ ] Bind `godot-sqlite` APIs to crush data storage performance issues
- [ ] Completely fixes the infinite loop problem
<br>

- [ ] Fix and provide full support for tags  
<br>

- [ ] Since typed JSON is essentially YAML, doesn’t that mean that as long as Godot’s JSON can provide typed data, we could support all engine data by inserting a thin middleware layer?  
- [ ] Wild idea (or particularly unsafe?): **What if we put `Callable` inside YAML?**
<br>

- [ ] If possible, fix PyYAML’s streaming functionality  
<br>

- [ ] Remind users that YAML isn’t a silver bullet
