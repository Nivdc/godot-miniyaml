I promise everything on this list will eventually be implemented (as long as I’m still alive 😅)—but I can’t say when.
If you need it tomorrow, you'll have to do it yourself.

TODO:  

- Fix compatibility between the two error-handling systems(`assert` and `YAMLResult`)  
- Allow loading data with missing fields  
<br>
- Provide a distribution package that doesn’t pollute the namespace  
- Create utility classes to reduce code duplication and offer richer reflection  capabilities  
- Added better behavior control settings  
- (Just for fun) Let's try dump miniyaml  
<br>
- Fix and provide full support for tags  
<br>
- Since typed JSON is essentially YAML, doesn’t that mean that as long as Godot’s JSON can provide typed data, we could support all engine data by inserting a thin middleware layer?  
<br>

- If possible, fix PyYAML’s streaming functionality  
<br>

- Remind users that YAML isn’t a silver bullet
